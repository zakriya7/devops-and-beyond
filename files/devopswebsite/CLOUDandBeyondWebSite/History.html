<h5>Lab Creation</h5>
<p>
The labs first started when I was building proof of concept designs specific to current migration needs.&nbsp;  I then modified them to be used by my user group.  After multiple iterations, I came up with the current labs.  &nbsp; I thought  they may be of help to others, so I our group decided to publish them.   &nbsp; 

</p>
<br>
<p>
<h5>History</h5>
The original name for the group was awsandbeyond and began June 2015.  &nbsp; &nbsp; I worked with a group of  IT Architects supporting three 
large Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) programs.  &nbsp;  Our team consisted of Architects who where responsible for end to end architecutre.  &nbsp; 
  &nbsp;I was handed the task to design a case management system for a bid that would be hosted in a FedRAMP certified cloud.  &nbsp; At the time,&nbsp; Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   was the only major cloud provider that was FedRAMP certified.  The move to AWS as well as a shift towards opensource software was a big change, from design through implementation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Quickly after I starting to work on the AWS bid, one of my colleagues was leaving the company.  &nbsp; 
It was clear that the cloud and open source was going to continue to be disruptive so I asked if he and another architect would be willing to have a 
site to share information as we focused on different areas of the changing technology stack.  &nbsp; They agreed,&nbsp; so I came up with a simple idea of using Google mail and Google drive as this repository.  &nbsp;  With AWS as the starting point and a vision that we had no idea what other clouds we would have to deal with, I named the account awsandbeyond@gmail.com.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h5>Creating the user group.</h5>
As I got further into AWS architecture and building prototypes, it became clear this would impact our various infrastructure and application teams.  &nbsp; I wanted a way to share the knowledge I was acquiring and help the teams learn the emerging skills.  &nbsp;   I created a user group and used the awsandbeyond@gmail.com drive to share scripts/labs I built specific to AWS build outs and migrations.  &nbsp;
By this time, another project I was working on was evaluating AWS also, so again I needed to put together the technical architecture, but this time for an AWS migration.  &nbsp;
I made more POCs and turned those into labs, and brought those to the user groups to do knowledge share.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Changing the name to Devopsandbeyond</h5>
After three years of working with my user group, I thought it would be a good idea
to publically publish the labs. The led me to change the name to Cloudandbeyond and 
clean up some of the labs and publish.

The challenge with AWS can be summarized as:
<li>What are we putting in AWS?  </li> 
<li>How are we putting it into AWS?</li>
<li>Who is putting it into AWS?</li>
<li>How are we securing it?</li>
<li>How are do we make it more available, performant</li>
<li>How do we manage changes?</li>
<li>Who is doing what do develop appropriate Roles?</li>
<br>
The labs I created are from when I was learning AWS, and progressing deeper into the platform and cloud-native technology. I hope they provide value to you in this fast paced world.
