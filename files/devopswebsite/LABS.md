[LINK:DevOps Repository](https://bitbucket.org/awsandbeyond/devopslab/src/master/)

__Problem__ It is hard to find how tools and DevOps models work together. 

__GOAL:__ To help students understand how the DevOps/SecDevOps tools work together and see them in one place.


__Outline__ These labs are simplified examples in order for students to better grasp how to use these tools together while implementing different platforms in AWS.

__Advanced Students__ 
These are stand alone labs. Advanced students can just start with the Bitcbucket repository without going through all or any of the AWS Architecture labs.
